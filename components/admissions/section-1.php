                prospectus
                along with the registration form is available at the school office. The registration form should be
                duely
                filled and submitted in the office before the due date.</p>

            <p>Childs Ability will be taken into consideration. A child has to compete for admission by appearing in a
                written and an oral aptitude and intelligence test. Admission to any class except pre-primary is made
                after
                a pre-admission test and on production of valid Transfer Certificates from the previous institution. The
                management of the school reserves all rights of admitting the child to the school.</p>
