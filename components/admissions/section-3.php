            <p>The school requires 90% attendance of the total working days during the academic year. A written
                application for leave must be submitted to the principal. The name of the student shall be struck off
                the roll if a student is continuously absent for 15 days. A student will not be re-admitted who is
                habitually late and undisciplined. Students shall not remain absent during examination days. The
                principal reserves the right to suspend the student or to ask the parent to withdraw a student from the
                school if his/her conduct or educational report is unsatisfactory.</p>
