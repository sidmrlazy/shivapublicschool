        <h3>Principal's Message</h3>
        <p>Learning is a lifelong process and Shiva Public School, Tiloi - Amethi envisages the all-round development of
            the
            children and caters to the needs of the students dwelling in the picturesque surroundings of our campus.
            Education is a joint venture and its attainment is a mutual undertaking in which Students, Teachers, parents
            and the Principal strive together hand in hand to translate this aim into reality. I feel proud to embark on
            a journey in which I would play a significant role in shaping the character of the future citizens of the
            country.</p>

        <p>In a fast changing world where change is probably only thing which is constant, it is high time we alter our
            approach towards teaching-learning process and foresee the students a co-learner and respect them for their
            individuality. Accommodating every individuality and respecting distinctiveness of every individual in the
            process of learning is the order of the day and as the Principal of the Shiva Public School, it would be my
            solemn duty to
            ensure the same is achieved through innovative practices, not only in the administrative procedures, but
            also in
            pedagogical approaches.</p>

        <p>Out of various stake holders, teachers, in all probability, play the most pivotal role in the overall
            development
            of the studentsâ€™ personality. A teacher of calm temperament and disposition may prove to be an asset and I
            as
            the head of this Vidyalaya, would provide them congenial and conducive environment to work together as a
            team to
            bring best out the students and make them self-sufficient learners.
            Through multifarious activities, the latent talent of the students would be brought to the fore.</p>
