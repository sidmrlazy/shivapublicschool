    <h3>Our Mission <span>& Vision</span></h3>
    <p>At Shiva Public School we continuously strive towards excellence in all aspects of education by
        adopting a holistic and dynamic curriculum and providing an emotionally stable and morally invigorating
        environment to all learners. We recognize the significance of imparting a didactic experience that is
        world-class and prepares children for global citizenship.</p>

    <p>We are a school that celebrates the culture of excellence and is an embodiment of values. The uniquely diverse
        instructive methodology helps to develop the body through competition and teamwork, the spirit through
        self-awareness and growth; and camaraderie through shared experience. The prime mission is to empower the
        students to be compassionate, responsive to our culture and heritage, academically proficient and acquire
        scientific temper in an environment of sharing and caring.</p>
