    <h2>A <span>WORD</span></h2>
    <p>A School is a place which enlightens the young minds. It is an institution of the society where students are
        trained and made ideal citizens of the world. Lucknow, the capital city of Uttar Pradesh has many well
        established and famous schools and colleges which are entirely accessible to the children hailing from rich and
        well to do families. These school and colleges impart good education by charging a hefty amount of money for
        maintaining a high level of school standard. A person belonging to an average middle class family and earning
        from the limited resources finds himself unable to bear the burden of expenses of hooping his words in these
        High Profile English Medium Schools. It always remains an unfulfilled dream of his to keep his child in those
        reputed school.</p>

    <p>Keeping this fact in view, Shiva Educational Society established an English Medium School with the name of Shiva
        Public School to provide the very best and quality education to the students which they would have got in one of
        the well known English Medium Schools of the city. We intend to cater to the demand of education of the students
        coming from the poor and financially backward families. It has been our keen interest that the benefits of good
        education should reach to those who really wish to have that and have been denied due to their weak financial
        circumstances. We believe that each and every child has the fundamental right of education. We pledge to strive
        for excellence in our future plans.</p>
